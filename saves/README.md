# Saves Directory

This directory contains saved game states. Save files are in JSON format and can be viewed/edited with any text editor.

## Files
- `quicksave.json` - Quick save slot (F5 to save, F9 to load)
- `save_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Timestamped manual saves (F6 to create)
- Custom named saves created via the API

## Backup
It's recommended to backup important saves before major game updates.
